Momentum MomEngine_64 2025.10.433 (*) built: Oct 23 2024
Copyright  1992 - 2024 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Thu Jan 23 16:42:47 2025
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.045 um for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.004 um.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
